I am an engineer who graduated from the IT Digital Imaging in the Ecole Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Rennes (ESIR - Rennes 1). I wish you a welcome to my portfolio!</p><p>For more than <span id='bio_duration'></span> years, computing, media, and electronics have taken more and more part of my daily life. Since my high school years, I started little by little to lead various projects. Which allowed me to discover computer science and to lead myself towards the development of software applications.</p><p>During my schooling, I obtained a UTD in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Computer Science which allowed me to discover electronics and industrial computer science. After this year, I decided to go on international mobility at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) in Glasgow to learn 3D through a Bsc Game Development. After that, I joined an engineering school where I had the opportunity to follow a unique training in France because it was dedicated to the vast field of digital imaging.</p><p>I put my skills into practice during different internships. In particular, within innovative companies with strong expertise, either in startup such as Askelys in which I developed a 3D WebGL Unity interface for their semantic web API. Or, either during my professionalization contract for more than a year at the b<>com Technology Research Institute, by my contribution to the development of an open-source Augmented Reality Framework.</p><p>All these challenges allowed me to improve myself personally and professionally. You can find below some of my projects. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my profile.</p><p>Cheers</p>"       }
