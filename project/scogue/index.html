                <h2>Project</h2>
				
				<p>
					<p>This game was designed for the HTML5 & JavaScript Game Programming module of the University of West of Scotland (UWS).</p>
					<p>The aim of this course was to create a basic playable browser game. However, this game must include few gameplay mechanics in order to discover and understand how a javascript game is working.</p>
					<p>As it was only a 2 months project, all student used a free library framework '<a href='https://phaser.io'>Phaser</a>' to help him to design his game.</p>
					<p>Being a great amateur of Rogue-Like game (as <a href="http://www.cellardoorgames.com/roguelegacy/">Rogue Legacy</a>, <a href="http://bindingofisaac.com/">The Binding of Isaac</a>,...), I decided to design a Rogue-Like game for this project : <b>Scogue</b>, my scottish rogue ! .

    <section id="mechanics" class="container content-section text-center">

            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
				<br/>
			   <h2>Mechanics</h2>
			   <p>
					In this part I will introduce the main gameplay mechanics.
			   </p>
				<p>
					<b>HealthPoint :</b> This features able to know if the player is alive or not. 
						</br> It is based on 2 points, the <u>maximum HealthPoint Pool</u> and the <u>current life</u> (which obviously can't be more important than the maximum HealthPoint pool)
						<p>
							When the HealthPoint of the player reach 0, you lose the life and also all of your progression...
							<br/>However, as the main design of the game is based on 'Rogue Like' you will be able to use the collected resources (coins, score) to upgrade your current stats for the next life ! Be carrefull to spend the maximum of your resources, because you will lose of all it by starting a new life.
						
						</p>
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					<b>Damage :</b> This features correspond to the based amount of damage you will inflict to your opponents
					</br>This value will be changing in function of the weapon used, there are <u>4 differents weapons gameplay available</u> (hammer, bow, axe, sword). The direction of you attack is depending of the player direction.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Armor :</b> The player have an amount of armor. This armor is used to calculate a percentage of armor reduction (logarithmic function) which will be able to prevent the player against important damage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Coins :</b>  Is a resource of the game using to buy new stuff providing more amor, damage, hp.. but also to acquire some spells (as double jump, dash..). You will gather it from monsters and interactive object of the game (as chest...)
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Speed :</b> Define the movement speed of the player, this can be modificated when the player is walking on some kind of ground (as for example ice, mud, ...) 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Invulnerability :</b> Is used to prevent the player and the monsters to take to much damage in a short time. The sprite will be blinking if the character is actually invulnerable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Jump :</b> Is based on 2 main points. Firstly the <u>Height</u> of the jump, in order to limit the direct access to some platform. And the <u>Delay</u> which fix the time between 2 jumps. It can be modificated with items
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Score / Time elapsed :</b> Both of this mechanics are working together. During your life, you will improve your score by killing your opponents. Whereas the time elapsed is just depending of the time played. When you are die, you will receive an amount of <u>"Glory"</u> depending of the score realised and the time elapsed (less you have played more it will be important).
					</br>The Glory is used as the resouces to upgrade your main characteristic (HealthPoint, Armor...), and it will be reset when you are starting a new life.
